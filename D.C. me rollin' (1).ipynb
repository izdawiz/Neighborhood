    "As a recent college graduate, I am looking forward to the oppurtunity to move into a city. Based off my career aspirations I will most likely be moving somewhere in Washington, D.C. I would love to move somewhere that has a strong resturant/coffee scene. My parents, however, are in favor of moving somewhere safe. In my parent's mind the areas I view as desirable to move to they view as \"unsafe.\" Which brings me to my research question: **Do the clusters of neighborhoods I'm interested in moving to intersect with \"unsafe\" areas of the city?** "

I will collect venue information to create clusters of similar areas throughout the city. The MPDC has data for all public arrests in 2017. I will use this data to evaluate the \"unsafe\" clusters of the city. Lastly, I will use a comination of wikipedia and google maps to create a DC ward/neighborhood reference data set. "
